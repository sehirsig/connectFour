Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. \
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. \
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. \
Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
